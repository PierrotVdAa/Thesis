This folder contains a binary classifier made to train and discover machine learning. It is based on a simple two classes classification task. The dataset used is about water drinkability and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/water-quality). The code has been implemented as instructed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q90UDEgYqeI).

The folder contains the following files:

- `Water_quality_classifier_02.ipynb`: the main file containing the code.
- `water_quality.csv`: the raw dataset.
- `Train_set.csv`: the train set for the analyses.
- `Test_set.csv`: the test set for the analyses.
- `tree_pruned_annotated.png`: the resulting pruned tree annotated to explain the different components of a classification tree.
